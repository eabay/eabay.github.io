WordPress served well but I am sick of trying to keep it up to date without writing a single line for years. It is absurd to create pages dynamically when there is no dynamic part at all. Octopress is a perfect solution to build a blog if you are familiar enough with terminal and markdown, no need to be a ninja.

I hope this is new era for my blogging career :p
